  "description": "Create a React application for cat lovers which is going to build upon thecatapi.com and will have 3 views.\r The **first** view displays a list of 10 random cat images and a button to load more. Clicking on any of those images opens a modal view with the image and the information about the catâ€™s breed if available. This would be a link to the second view below - the breed detail. The modal should also contain a form to mark the image as your favourite (a part of the third view as well). Make sure you can copy-paste the URL of the modal and send it to your friends - they should see the same image as you can see.",
